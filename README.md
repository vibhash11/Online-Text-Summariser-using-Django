# Online-Text-Summariser-using-Django
An online text summarizer that takes file, length of required summary and the choice of algorithm as input. You can see the project live [here](http://vibhash.pythonanywhere.com). Uses Django as the web framework and [sumy](https://github.com/miso-belica/sumy) for the text summarization algorithms. It was developed as an extension to a [research paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/8423533/) that my team and I wrote but the algorithm from the paper has not yet been added to this project as there is a dependeny on PERL language which I haven't figured out how to merge with Python.

To run on localhost - 
```sh
$ py manage.py runserver
```
